1. ``400 Bad Request`` while creation
--------------------------------------

While creating either a VPC or a POD, the program might issue a ``400 Bad Request`` error as shown below::

	oto.exception.EC2ResponseError: EC2ResponseError: 400 Bad Request
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<Response><Errors><Error><Code>InvalidVpcID.NotFound</Code><Message>The vpc ID 'vpc-xxxx' does not exist</Message></Error></Errors><RequestID>xxxx-xxxx</RequestID></Response>

This happens when the AWS is still processing your previous request or if there is a delay between requests. In such a case, please wait for a minute or two for AWS server to sync and then try the same command again. Do not worry about duplicate creations, CloudWhip is mostly Idempotent.
